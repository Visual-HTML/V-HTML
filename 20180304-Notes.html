Browser print preview or other rendering environment can complete another form of "save as" function: print to file
<p>
without providing any code within the page application I get the function available.
<p>
This is not more in the document authoring cycle and saved document using this path become leaf documents 
  and become of another format (pdf or other file print driver) than html.
<p>
the screenshot of the application workspace can also be used to save a document
<p>
The editor code is removed from the file: solution to turn back to edit ?
<p>
201803: Have paused development on VH20 for about 6 months now, next effort will be to 
 <p> - use vh20 redefined as an object declaration and its default dynamic resource reference processing
   (cross-browsers generations), browser classification removed: the developer tell on what u-a was written 
   and tested the code
 <p> - provide a save as function on all browsers no matter what browser api, device' file system technology, is available
   * ! its a reduced complexity context: Ifocus here only on js files- then there are the css and the document structure to
   process...
<p>in new vh20 version:the key is the full user-agent value, default process add after vh20.js all files declared for that 
  u-a value.
<p>the case of long documents: eg the html spec modified to run inline editor ? 5gb of elements ?
<p>review editor behavior: manage auto-formatting after copy/paste or drag&drop + basic formatting of text...
